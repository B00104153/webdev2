<h2> About me </h2>

<p> Hello, my name is Marcin and I was born in 1999, Nowa Ruda, Poland. My interest in photography, design and cameras began at the age of 10.<br>
    That was the first time I had ever came across the actually process of designing something and a time where I got to take photos with a profesional camera.<br>
	I instantly fell in love with idea of being able to capture any true and important moment with a camera and design anything I could think of in my mind. That aspect of photography and design
	captivated me, I thought the idea of capturing a moment was like frezzing time on a screen allowing us to re-visit anytime.
	<br>
	After all thats what photography is about being able to capture the moments that are most important to us.
